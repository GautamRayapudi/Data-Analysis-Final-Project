Raw data file is too big to upload, please refer to this link to access: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y44lMaqine2asXE0784lKPj2Ry5efe7k?usp=sharing                    
And to access the 'dashboard', type 'jupyter lab' in anaconda prompt and run it, then open the downloaded 'dashboard' file in the jupyter lab and then copy the csv/excel/pickle file location of the dataset and then convert it to dataframe using pd.read_csv/excel (or) use pickle read. Then run the codes available in the 'dashboard' which involve the 'pywedge' usage predominantly and then you will be able to access an interactive dashboard for the columns available in the dataset.
Hope this helpsðŸ˜„.
